## [2.18.16] : 2026-11-01

### Changed
* Streamlined Edit Component Modal (`AddEditItemModal.tsx`):
  - Form reduced strictly to the 4 essential fields: **Name** &rarr; **Domain** &rarr; **Total Units** &rarr; **Description**.
  - Removed all extraneous inputs (available units override, condition, datasheet URL, and status preview cards).

***

## [2.18.15] : 2026-11-01

### Added
* Standalone database migration `supabase_remove_location_migration.sql` to drop or make nullable the component location column.
* Centered `DragToConfirm` slider at the bottom of the component detail preview.

### Changed
* Redesigned Component Preview Modal (`ItemDetailModal.tsx`):
  - macOS terminal window title bar with authentic `#ff5f56`, `#ffbd2e`, `#27c93f` dots and monospace filename indicator.
  - Increased width (`max-w-2xl`) with crisp, clean text alignment and no heavy neon shadow borders.
  - Placed "Slide to Request Item" (`DragToConfirm`) centered at the bottom of the modal.
  - Strict Admin-only visibility and clearance check for the "Edit Component" option.
* Completely removed component `location` from:
  - Database schemas (`supabase_schema.sql`, `neon_schema.sql`)
  - TypeScript interface (`InventoryItem.location?`)
  - All inventory UI cards, tables, search filters, and modals (`ItemDetailModal`, `ComponentVaultView`, `InventoryCard`, `InventoryList`, `AddEditItemModal`, `BorrowModal`, `RequestCartModal`, `IssuePassModal`, `UserDashboard`).

***

## [2.18.14] : 2026-11-01

### Added
* Admin Component Editing from Inventory Page:
  - Added dedicated **Edit Component** action buttons on all catalog component cards in `ComponentVaultView.tsx`, visible exclusively to authenticated Administrator accounts.
  - Added an **Edit Component** action button within `ItemDetailModal.tsx` for fast editing when inspecting detailed hardware specifications.
  - Built full interactive editing in `AddEditItemModal.tsx` allowing administrators to modify component name, category, lab storage location, condition, datasheet URL, and specifications.
  - Added robust support for setting quantity to `0` with automatic re-evaluation of stock status to `Out of Stock (Depleted)` and immediate reflection across all member dashboards.
  - Backed by Supabase database persistence with service-role fallback (`supabaseAdmin`) and automatic activity logging (`UPDATE_ITEM`).

***

## [2.18.13] : 2026-11-01

### Added
* Tabular Club Members Roster with Admin Priority Ordering:
  - Replaced the two-column card grid in `AdminHubView.tsx` with a clean, high-clarity table layout maintaining authentic vault theme backgrounds (`dark:bg-[#14141c]`, neutral borders, zero purple background cast).
  - Implemented strict hierarchical role sorting with dedicated section separators: `Administrators` displayed first, followed by `Club Members` with standard clearance.
  - Renamed columns to `Enrollment Number` and `Role`, removing extraneous subtitle descriptions for a clean tabular layout.
  - Added interactive role filter pills with live member counts (`All Roles`, `Admins`, `Members`).
  - Polished management action controls with muted, non-neon buttons and clear role state badges.

### Changed
* Dock Navigation Tab Renamed to Management:
  - Updated `BottomNavbar.tsx` dock navigation tab from `Logs` to `Management` featuring a dedicated `ShieldCheck` icon, aligning seamlessly with the Management Hub breadcrumb.
* Streamlined Activity History Filters:
  - Streamlined log timeframe filters to `Last 24 Hours` (default) and `Last 3 Days`, removing legacy 7-day presets and removing the "Real-time Activity Feed" label.

***

## [2.18.12] : 2026-11-01

### Added
* Admin Approval & Rejection Attribution in Requisitions Portal:
  - Displayed the approving or rejecting administrator's name (`Approved by: <Admin>` / `Rejected by: <Admin>`) on all clearance cards in `RequisitionsView.tsx` with dedicated status indicators.
  - Enhanced admin attribution fallback resolution in `InventoryContext.tsx` to pull from profile name, auth metadata, or email identifier.

### Removed
* Redundant Lab Location Field:
  - Removed the `Lab Location: ...` display from requisition and clearance cards in `RequisitionsView.tsx`, providing a cleaner and focused requisition timeline.

***

## [2.18.11] : 2026-11-01

### Changed
* Meet the Team Big Screen Layout Refinement:
  - Shifted the Big Screen developer showcase card upward in `MeetTheDevelopers.tsx` with optimized vertical offsets (`-mt-3 sm:-mt-5 md:-mt-6` and `space-y-3 sm:space-y-4`).
  - Streamlined card interior padding (`p-5 sm:p-7 md:p-8`) and balanced the avatar ring diameter, granting comfortable clearance from the floating bottom navigation dock without content crowding.

***

## [2.18.10] : 2026-11-01

### Fixed
* Complete Component Return & Authentic 53-Component Inventory Restoration:
  - Pruned 12 legacy mock items that had bloated the database to 65 components and 324 assets, safely re-linking prior loan activity to live components.
  - Returned 100% of borrowed components across the entire inventory, setting `available_qty = total_qty` (all 172 units in stock, 0 unreturned units) and status `'In Stock'`.
  - Reconciled all borrow requests to `'returned'` with return dates and cleared notes.
  - Mirrored the clean 53-component database state to Neon PostgreSQL.
  - Updated `supabase_schema.sql` seed definitions with the 53 authentic CICR hardware components.
  - Added repository automation utility `scripts/restore_inventory.cjs` for automated catalog health verification.

***

## [2.18.9] : 2026-11-01

### Added
* User-Exclusive Component Return Workflow & Admin Clearance Portal:
  - Added strict ownership validation (`user_id === user.id || user_email === user.email`) ensuring only the member who borrowed a component (or an administrator) can initiate its return. Other members viewing the component modal only see public checkout history and cannot trigger returns.
  - Added a dedicated "Your Active Checkout" card directly in `ItemDetailModal.tsx` displaying the member's current units in possession, checkout date, expected return date, and an interactive "Return Component" button.
  - Added return clearance request pipeline: clicking return prompts for optional return notes (e.g., condition or bin location) and submits a return request directly to the Admin Portal (`admin_notes: [RETURN_REQUESTED]`).
  - Implemented real-time status indication: while return clearance is pending, borrowers and administrators see a pulsing purple `Return Clearance Pending` / `Return Request Sent (Awaiting Admin)` badge.
  - Added a "Returns" filter tab and counter badge in `RequisitionsView.tsx` with one-click admin clearance actions: "Approve Return & Restock" (which increments inventory stock, updates actual return date, sends email confirmation, and logs to audit history) and "Decline" with reason input.
  - Added real-time notification alerts in `TopNavbar` and navigation dock badge counters in `BottomNavbar` for pending return clearance requests.

***

## [2.18.8] : 2026-11-01

### Fixed
* Serverless Function Invocations & SMTP Timeout Safeguards:
  - Added race-safe execution timeouts (`Promise.race` with 4.5s/5s bounds) to email transmissions in `api/accounts.ts` and `api/email.ts`, preventing unhandled 500 `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` exceptions on Vercel.
  - Lowered SMTP socket, greeting, and connection timeouts to 4000ms in `api/_mailer.ts` and configured `maxDuration: 15` in `vercel.json` to prevent serverless function terminations.
  - Eliminated the `Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected in the same browser context` warning by assigning an isolated `storageKey` to `supabaseAdmin`.
  - Fixed GitHub Actions `backup.yml` pipeline by upgrading the Node.js runner to version 22 and adding a WebSocket fallback shim for `@supabase/supabase-js`.

***

## [2.18.7] : 2026-11-01

### Fixed
* Full TypeScript & IDE Diagnostics Alignment:
  - Reinstalled and updated `@types/nodemailer` and added `@types/pg` devDependencies to resolve missing type definitions for PostgreSQL and email modules in the editor.
  - Updated `tsconfig.json` to include `"api"` alongside `"src"`, enabling unified IDE type-checking and eliminating editor squiggles and false-positive diagnostics across all serverless API endpoints (`accounts.ts`, `email.ts`, `reminders.ts`).
  - Resolved `createTransport` option overload typing in `api/_mailer.ts`.

***

## [2.18.6] : 2026-11-01

### Fixed
* Account Requests Ghost Resurfacing: Fixed an issue where approved or rejected accounts persisted or reappeared in the "Account Requests" tab.
  - Updated `fetchPendingAccounts` in `UserDashboard.tsx` to maintain a comprehensive set of resolved accounts (`resolvedEmails` and `resolvedUserIds`), filtering out any user marked as approved, rejected, or admin across both `profiles` and `activity_logs`.
  - Fixed avatar status sync during approvals and rejections (`avatar_url: 'status:approved'` / `avatar_url: 'status:rejected'`), ensuring old `'status:pending'` avatar values do not cause profiles to be miscategorized as pending.
  - Multi-Log Synchronization: Both `/api/accounts` and client fallback routines now update all related `ACCOUNT_REQUEST` entries in `activity_logs` rather than just the first found record.
  - Immediate Cache Pruning: `handleApproveAccount` and `handleRejectAccount` now immediately prune the target account by both ID and email from local state before refetching.

***

## [2.18.5] : 2026-11-01

### Added
* Backend Connected Role Promotions & Demotions: Connected the "Promote to Admin" / "Demote to Member" actions to the backend `/api/accounts` endpoint via `updateUserRole` in `AuthContext`.
* Full Stack Synchronization: Role changes now synchronously update Supabase Postgres `profiles`, Supabase Auth `user_metadata` (`supabase.auth.admin.updateUserById`), and mirror to Neon PostgreSQL (`NEON_DATABASE_URL`).
* Audit Logging & Email Notifications: Automatically logs role promotions and demotions to `activity_logs` with admin and member identifiers and dispatches a dedicated `role_updated` notification email to the affected user.
* UI Feedback & Protection: Added button loading state (`Updating...`), disabled interactions during processing, and enforced safeguards preventing self-demotion or alteration of master superadministrator accounts.

### Fixed
* Zero-Flicker Sign-In Authorization Gate: Resolved the visual screen flicker where unapproved applicants briefly saw the dashboard mount before being logged out. Implemented `checkUserApproval` in `onAuthStateChange` and `initSession` and added an authorization guard in `App.tsx` (`isApproved`) to block unauthorized dashboard renders at the root level.
* Pending Registration Portal Messaging: Added prominent Amber banner feedback on `LoginForm` notifying applicants that their registration request has been submitted to the Admin Portal and is awaiting administrator authorization before sign-in can proceed.
* Sanitized Initial Storage Hydration: Refactored `getInitialAuth` to ignore unapproved or rejected cached session records from local storage.

***

## [2.18.4] : 2026-11-01

### Fixed
* Google SMTP Password Fallback & Credentials Sanitization: Corrected the encoded base64 Google App Password fallback in `api/_mailer.ts` (`ezoufqenvifmudgv`) and added automatic whitespace/quote sanitization for 16-character Google App Passwords.
* Serverless SMTP Connection Stability: Set `pool: false` and added 8-second connection, greeting, and socket timeouts on nodemailer transporters to eliminate stale socket reuse and prevent serverless `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` timeouts on Vercel.
* Fault-Tolerant Account Emails: Wrapped `sendAccountEmail` in `api/accounts.ts` and `api/reminders.ts` in non-blocking try-catch blocks to prevent email delivery hiccups from breaking core user registration, approvals, or cron execution.
* Serverless JSON Body Parsing: Added resilient body parsing in `api/email.ts` and `api/accounts.ts` to cleanly handle both parsed JSON objects and raw payload strings across edge and node runtimes.

***

## [2.18.3] : 2026-11-01

### Fixed
* Account Requests Detection: Enhanced `fetchPendingAccounts` in `UserDashboard.tsx` to cross-reference both `profiles` and `activity_logs` (`ACCOUNT_REQUEST`) to reliably surface all pending registration requests in the Management Hub even if direct profile row insertion was delayed or bypassed.
* Club Members Roster Hygiene: Updated `fetchAllMembers` to strictly filter for approved accounts, keeping pending applicants separated until authorized by an administrator.
* Client Signup Profile Synchronization: Fixed client-side registration fallback in `AuthContext.tsx` to explicitly write `status: initialStatus` and `role: enforcedRole` during profile upserts.

***

## [2.18.2] : 2026-10-31

### Fixed
* Responsive Notification Panel Positioning: Fixed horizontal overflow on mobile viewports by anchoring panel with `fixed top-[4.5rem] inset-x-2.5 mx-auto max-w-sm` on mobile and `sm:absolute sm:top-full sm:right-0 sm:w-[410px]` on desktop, eliminating viewport clipping.
* Mobile Touch Backdrop: Added semi-transparent backdrop overlay on mobile devices to focus the notification panel and enable intuitive single-tap dismissal outside the container.
* Touch and Keyboard Outside Dismissal: Added `touchstart` and `keydown` (Escape key) listeners alongside `mousedown` to ensure responsive dismissal on all touchscreens and desktop setups.
* TopNavbar Stacking Priority: Increased `TopNavbar` stacking index to `z-50` to guarantee notification dropdown floats cleanly above all content and docks.

### Added
* Notification Filter Tabs: Introduced interactive "All" and "Unread" tab toggles with morphing indicator to filter notification streams dynamically.
* Actionable Dismissal and Clear Controls: Added individual notification dismiss buttons, one-click "Clear all" tray action, and "Read all" quick action.
* Comprehensive Alert Streams: Expanded notification triggers to include declined requisition notices for members and pending user registration reviews for administrators.

***

## [2.18.1] : 2026-10-31

### Fixed
* Responsive Category Navigation Submenu: Centered floating catalog category submenu directly above the bottom navigation dock across both mobile and desktop viewports.
* Mobile Viewport Boundary Clamping: Constrained submenu container to `max-w-[calc(100vw-1.5rem)]` with smooth touch momentum scrolling and hidden scrollbars to prevent horizontal clipping.
* Filter Key Synchronization: Aligned category keys between `BottomNavbar.tsx` and `ComponentVaultView.tsx` (`mcu` and `microcontrollers`), restoring interactive real-time category filtering.
* Touch Event Recognition: Added `touchstart` listener alongside `mousedown` to ensure clean outside-dismissal on touch devices.

***

## [2.18.0] : 2026-10-31

### Added
* Personalized Member Active Loans Filter: Configured active loans metric and status filter in Component Vault to display strictly personalized loan counts for normal members, while administrators retain full visibility over all member loans across the lab.
* Dynamic Card Subtitle: Active loans card dynamically indicates "Checked out by you" for members and "Checked out by members" for administrators.

### Changed
* Streamlined Requisition Clearance: Removed locker and collection instructions text input field from pending requisitions in `RequisitionsView.tsx` for a cleaner, one-click authorization workflow.

### Fixed
* Persistent Notification Read State: Fixed "Read all" button in the notification popover by connecting handler to persistent local storage synchronization, ensuring marked alerts do not reappear during real-time polling intervals.
* System Inventory Stock Restoration: Verified all outstanding borrow requests as returned and restored full 100% available stock across all 53 hardware components.

***

* Base64 Decoded Production SMTP Fallbacks: Integrated resilient failover decoders in `api/_mailer.ts` and `api/reminders.ts` ensuring automated emails send reliably across local, serverless, and cloud deployments.
* Cron Return Reminders Service: Added automated due date reminder endpoint in `api/reminders.ts` querying impending and overdue item returns.
* Production Environment Templates: Updated `.env` and `.env.example` with standard Google SMTP parameters.

***

## [2.16.0] : 2026-10-31

### Added
* Failover Client Decoders: Added base64 decoding utilities in `src/lib/supabase.ts` to guarantee production fallback credentials load seamlessly even when host environment variables are absent.
* Direct Supabase Failovers: Added resilient fallback pathways in `AuthContext.tsx` for account registration, administrative approval, and account rejection directly via `supabaseAdmin` if serverless API routes are unreachable.
* Vercel API Rewrite Guard: Reinstated serverless route rewrites in `vercel.json` for all `/api/(.*)` paths.

### Fixed
* Resolved blank white screen on Vercel deployment caused by top level unhandled exceptions on missing environment variables.
* Cleaned up multiline template escape sequences across asynchronous handlers.
* Full cross branch parity established across `main`, `UI-UX-Updates`, `Docs`, `Backend-Updates`, and `Emailing-Updates`.

***
