### Telemetry Pipeline
1. **User Action Dispatch**: Operators or administrators execute an action (sign in, stage hardware, submit requisition, issue approval, return component).
2. **Optimistic Local Update**: The client immediately updates UI state and increments local activity counters.
3. **Primary Supabase Transaction**: The action commits to Supabase PostgreSQL using atomic SQL updates.
4. **Audit Log Generation**: An event payload is asynchronously written to `public.activity_logs`.
5. **Background Auto-Sync**: The active polling cycle (every 1.5s) reconciles discrepancies across concurrent clients.
6. **Secondary Mirror Sync**: Scheduled scripts duplicate recent records to the secondary Neon database.

## Database Schema & Real-Time Tables

### 1. `public.profiles`
Stores verified operator identities, institutional contact information, and role privileges:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.profiles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    full_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    username TEXT UNIQUE,
    roll_number TEXT,
    phone TEXT,
    role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'member' CHECK (role IN ('member', 'lead', 'admin')),
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')),
    avatar_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2. `public.inventory_items`
Holds the physical laboratory inventory catalog across five hardware categories:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.inventory_items (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (category IN ('Microcontrollers', 'Sensors', 'Actuators', 'Power', 'Tools')),
    description TEXT,
    location TEXT NOT NULL,
    total_qty INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 CHECK (total_qty >= 0),
    available_qty INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 CHECK (available_qty >= 0 AND available_qty <= total_qty),
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'In Stock' CHECK (status IN ('In Stock', 'Low Reserves', 'Depleted')),
    image_url TEXT,
    datasheet_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 3. `public.borrow_requests`
Maintains hardware requisition status, approval clearance, expected loan timelines, and return timestamps:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.borrow_requests (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_email TEXT NOT NULL,
    enrollment_no TEXT,
    item_id UUID REFERENCES public.inventory_items(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    item_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 CHECK (quantity >= 1),
    project_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    purpose TEXT,
    expected_return_date DATE NOT NULL,
    actual_return_date DATE,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'returned')),
    admin_notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 4. `public.activity_logs`
Records all audit events across the platform with automated time-based retention:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.activity_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID,
    user_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_email TEXT NOT NULL,
    action TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (category IN ('auth', 'inventory', 'hardware', 'loans', 'system')),
    details TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Production Indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_inventory_category ON public.inventory_items (category);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_borrow_status ON public.borrow_requests (status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_borrow_user ON public.borrow_requests (user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_activity_created ON public.activity_logs (created_at DESC);
```

## 7-Day Audit Logs & Telemetry Engine

The centralized audit engine monitors all operational activity within the laboratory management platform:

### 1. Event Classification
- **`auth`**: Operator registrations, approvals, rejections, password changes, and superadmin promotions.
- **`inventory`**: Component additions, deletions, specification updates, and stock corrections.
- **`hardware`**: Physical hardware disbursements, storage bay reassignments, and collection verifications.
- **`loans`**: Loan requests submitted, clearance approvals, rejection notices, and return confirmations.
- **`system`**: Secondary database backups, cache invalidations, and system health checks.

### 2. Time-Window Filtering
The Admin Control Center provides interactive range filtering:
- **`7 Days (All)`**: Complete rolling audit trail within the standard retention window.
- **`Last 3 Days`**: High-priority recent operational events.
- **`Today (24h)`**: Active day activity ledger with live event count badges.

### 3. Automated Retention & Pruning
Activity logs older than 7 days are automatically pruned during scheduled maintenance routines to maintain lean database tables and sub-10ms query execution times.

---

## Dual Superadmin & Institutional Auth Guard

### Master Whitelist Enforcement
Master administrative access is hardcoded to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation:
- `vardaansaxena096@gmail.com`
- `cicrinventory@gmail.com`

Any attempt to revoke or modify these master accounts is automatically blocked by application logic and database triggers.

### Institutional Domain Policy
Student accounts must authenticate using the official `@mail.jiit.ac.in` domain. Unverified or external domains cannot register as standard student operators.

### Synchronous Session Hydration
To eliminate page-refresh blinks and cold-start latency:
1. `AuthContext` executes `getInitialAuth()` synchronously from `localStorage` during initial script evaluation.
2. If an active session exists, the operator state is instantly hydrated before React renders its first DOM frame.
3. Supabase verifies the session in the background with a 1200ms timeout guard to prevent UI lockups on slow network connections.

## Multi-Tier Hardware Queue & Clearance Portal

### Clearance States & State Transitions

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending: Member Submits Requisition
    Pending --> Approved: Admin Grants Clearance
    Pending --> Rejected: Admin Rejects Request
    Approved --> Returned: Borrower Dispatches Return
    Returned --> [*]: Physical Check & Restock
    Rejected --> [*]
```

1. **Pending**: Staged by the member with project title, purpose, and return deadline. Hardware quantity is reserved but cannot be physically issued.
2. **Approved**: Verified by an administrator. Locker or rack collection notes are dispatched to the borrower.
3. **Rejected**: Cancelled by an administrator with explanatory feedback. Staged quantity is released back to available inventory.
4. **Returned**: Hardware returned to the lab. Once physically verified by the administrator, stock is restored to 100% capacity.

---

## Secondary Redundancy & Synchronization Engine

To guarantee 99.9% uptime during primary cloud service interruptions:
1. **Primary Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL handles real-time read and write operations.
2. **Secondary Mirror**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL stores full schema and transaction backups.
3. **Backup Workflow**: Executed via `scripts/backup_to_neon.cjs` on scheduled intervals.
4. **Client Failover**: In the event of primary connection failure, the frontend authentication handler gracefully falls back to secondary verification endpoints.

## Back-of-the-Envelope (BOTE) Scalability Analysis

| Metric | Estimation | Scalability Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Active Catalog Size** | 172 Components | Full catalog cached in client state; network payload < 45 KB gzipped. |
| **Concurrent Borrowers** | 500+ Active Members | Read-heavy workload with Supabase PostgreSQL connection pooling. |
| **Audit Log Volume** | ~2,500 logs / week | 7-day rolling window retains database index size < 2 MB. |
| **Background Polling** | 1.5s interval | Lightweight diff querying (`HEAD` and status counters) prevents server strain. |
| **Vercel Edge Delivery** | Global Anycast | Static assets and bundled chunks cached at CDN edge with sub-50ms TTFB. |
